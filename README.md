# AdventofCode2022

I don't have nearly enough time for this but it's December 1, my wife is still sleeping, and it can't hurt just to take a look, can it?


## Thoughts - Day 3
This has been really good so far. The problems haven't been too taxing and I've known how to solve them. I'm trying to 
use better programming technique so there's a dilemma - use the solution I don't need to google, or look things up and find better methods of solving. That was obvious today - inelegant solution for part 1, pythonic part 2.

## Day 11
Today it got tough. I made heave weather with the day 7 and day 8 - not sure what the bug was with day 8 but I fixed it - but part 2 today was a step up.

The rope bridge on day 9 looked like it would be a difficult challenge but that was typical AoC - looks hard, turns out fun; looks fun, turns out hard.


## Code That Might Be Useful
`input = [x for x in open('input.txt').read().split('\n')]`
sets - remember to use them
